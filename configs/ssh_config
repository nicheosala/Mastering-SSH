## Check the protocol ##
# There exist two versions of SSH protocol: 1 and 2.
# Version 1 has been deprecated (TODO: why?).
# The following line enforces the usage of verson 2.
Protocol 2

## Disable X11 forwarding ##
# This guide is intended for use with remote servers.
# Generally speaking, there is no reason to use a GUI 
# for a remote server. So disable X11 forwarding.
ForwardX11 no

## Public key authentication ##
# Explicitly allow authentication through SSH keys.
PubkeyAuthentication yes

## Key exchange ##
# After the client opens a TCP connection with the server,
# the first 'real' step of the SSH protocol is the key exchange:
# the client and the server uses an algorithm in order to share
# a secret key. There are basically two ways to do key exchange:
# Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman.
# We will use only the most secure algorithm. You can find its
# detailed description here:
# https://git.libssh.org/projects/libssh.git/tree/doc/curve25519-sha256@libssh.org.txt
KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org

## Client authentication ##
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa

## Symmetric ciphers ##
# Symmetric ciphers are used to encrypt the data after the initial key
# exchange and authentication is complete.
Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com

## Message authentication codes ##
# Encryption provides confidentiality, message authentication code
# provides integrity. We need both. If an AE cipher mode is selected,
# then extra MACs are not used, the integrity is already given.
# If CTR is selected, then we need a MAC to calculate and attach
# a tag to every message.
MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com

## Hash known hosts ##
# Ensure KnownHosts are unreadable if leaked - it is otherwise
# easier to know which hosts your keys have access to.
HashKnownHosts yes
